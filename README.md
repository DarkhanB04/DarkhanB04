### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Darkhan!
I'm from Kazakhstan, and doing some design and development. I really enjoy to create websites with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Currently, my goal - is to be the best web developer of my country.
Learning React.Js, and projects will be here, in github. If you want to see my projects, please go and watch, I left links for all.

Contact me via telegram: https://t.me/idrxkn

I am beginner in development, so I don't have a lot of stars.
